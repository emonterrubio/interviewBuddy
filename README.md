Framer prototype works on Chrome, Firefox and Safari

## Description
Interviewers for engineering roles at Facebook have multiple interviews in one day and do not have a convenient and easy way to view candidate information, interview details or a way to provide quick written feedback during or after their interviews.

## Goals
I wanted to validate whether a mobile approach would streamline the interviewer experience and expedite the crucial feedback process while providing interview and candidate insights along with ways to take quick action.

• Provide users with prompt and accurate info about candidates (resume, linkedIn).</br>

• Provide users with detail info about their upcoming interviews (schedule, loops, location, recruiter notes).</br>

• Provide users with the ability to alert POC about interview and/or candidate status.</br>

• Encourage users to provide quick notes and candidate feedback.</br>

• Encourage users to take and upload code pics.
