## Description:
Interviewers at Facebook do not have a way to view detail information about their interviews, the candidates they're interviewing, where they're interviewing or provide any quick written feedback during or after their interviews via mobile.

## Requirements:
### Pre-Interview
• Provide overall loop interview info (Candidate's profile, interview details, Notes to interviewers, General notes, etc)</br>

• Interview location details (space view map)
Point of contact (Recruiter and coordinator profile links)</br>

• Ability to see what other questions have been asked by previous interviewers

### During-Interview
• Quick notes section capability</br>
• Code pics snapshots

### Post-interview
• Ability to provide quick and easy feedback about the candidate (Hiring decision, confidence, questions asked, etc)</br>

• Access to your notes written during the interview</br>

• Ability to upload code pics if any to the interview feedback tool

## Outcome:
I iterated on animation timing, refining table view expansion

## APIs Used:
Highcharts, Mapbox
